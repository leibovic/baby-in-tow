    "Plenty of stroller space on the patio. Indoors, there is space for strollers but it can quickly get crowded on a weekend. Doors are not accessible but access to everything is at ground level, including the bathrooms.",
  nursingTips: "All seating is exposed but vibe of the cafe is very relaxed.",
